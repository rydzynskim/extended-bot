# Extend Chatbot

This is a command line chatbot that has extension capabilities integrated.

### Setup

An OpenAi api key is needed to run this chatbot as it uses the `gpt-3-turbo` model for inference. Please get a key from the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/) and then add it to your bash profile as `export OPENAI_API_KEY='replace_with_key'`. You'll have to add a few bucks to your account.

### Development

Simply run the following steps to start the chatbot:

1. `nvm use`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev`
